#	Reflection

I really must say that I'm kind of surprised that I use social media as much as I do. I know and I feel that it takes an substantial amount of time of my life, that I could be spending with my beloved ones instead. 
Maybe I'm addicted to it and I need a way to get rid of it. One thing that my girlfriend has done is to get rid of the Facebook app from her phone. This leads to less notifications on your phone, and that's a good thing. I know that I can easily be distracted by notifications on my phone, and that takes away some of my time that I could be doing something else instead of using Facebook. Maybe get better grades or develop some cool new app. I think I mostly use Facebook when I'm bored and have nothing better to do than to read about other peoples life.
I find that kind of strange, since I do think I live a good life. I have a lovely family and a lovely girlfriend. What does Facebook and this social web bringing to me, that I don't already have? Am I missing something?

Social media is kind of a two-edged sword were we have the need for privacy on one side, and the need to be reached at any point in time on the other side. This is not only unhealthy but it makes us more stressed out in the long term.
	
"For those who post status updates, the reinforcements keep coming in the form of supportive comments and 'likes.' And of course we know that behaviors that are consistently reinforced will be repeated, so it becomes hard for a person who has developed this habit to simply stop." [@stressed]
	
Personally I think I need more time for both school and being alone. This kind of "available all the time" mentality kind of brings you down I think. 

Apart from all the bad things I associate with social media, there's a lot of positive things about it to. It brings us together more easily, no matter where you're are.

"We are truly wealthy in our network." [@network, 5] 

with that the author wants to tell us about how easy and conveniently modern communication systems have become. We can contact our friends and family with just a few clicks on a screen, but brings this new technology only good things?

"Paradoxically, the technology that promises to connect people also threatens to overload them with extra work." [@network,10]

What the author tries to tell us is that it may or may not cause "information overload". It means that we're constantly notified about new things instantly and that may or may not lead to more work. We get so much information all the time that we cannot complete or process the information we just got.
I can surely relate to this, and I think it's a huge problem.

A lot of my entries in the above diary is caused by this.
One thing I can think about to prevent this from happening is to simply turn the notifications off. These notifications that pops up on my screen can be very distracting and causing me to loose tracks.

But why do I still use social media, even if it's bad for me sometimes? I think it has something to do with our social codes in society. We want to know what happens around us, and what affects us. In the beginning (around 2008) I was very skeptical to social media. Why would you use it? I had MSN and I used it frequently to talk to my friends all around the country. But social media had at least one advantage. Expression of feelings and opinions. Suddenly everyone could report what's happening around us. Suddenly the internet became just like a small village with people gossiping and spreading rumors.
This can be very interesting and I do read a lot of the discussions about politics and the society in general.
Facebook and other social media makes it easy to find people who thinks like you and may have similar opinions. That's comforting but I also think it may cause problems. If we never need to challenge ourselves and our believes we may become "blind" for other possibilities. If we only have one belief and we stick to it, we may never accept other peoples side of the story. I do think about this, and I hope that I'm being a open minded person, even online.
